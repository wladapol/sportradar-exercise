# Live Football World Cup Score Board Library  
  
This library provides a simple implementation of a Live Football World Cup Score Board. It allows users to start new matches, update scores, finish matches, and retrieve a summary of ongoing matches.  
  

## Approach

The implementation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, resulting in a straightforward Java library. It emphasizes SOLID and KISS principles to ensure clean, maintainable code. Additionally, it utilizes an in-memory store, primarily as a list, for efficient data management. The technology stack includes Java, Gradle, and JUnit.
  
## Usage  
  
### Starting a New Match  
  
To start a new match, use the `startMatch()` method in the `Scoreboard` class. Provide the home team and away team as parameters.  
  
```java  
Scoreboard scoreboard = new Scoreboard();  
Team homeTeam = new Team("Poland");  
Team awayTeam = new Team("Germany");  
scoreboard.startMatch(homeTeam, awayTeam);  
```

### Updating Scores

To update scores for a match, retrieve the match from the scoreboard using the `findMatch()` method and then use the `updateScore()` method in the `Match` class.

```java  
Match match = scoreboard.findMatch(homeTeam, awayTeam);
match.updateScore(2, 3);
```

### Finishing a Match

To finish a match, use the `finishMatch()` method in the `Scoreboard` class, passing the match object as a parameter.

```java
`scoreboard.finishMatch(match);`
```

### Retrieving Summary of Matches

To retrieve a summary of ongoing matches, use the `calculateSummary()` method in the `Scoreboard` class.

```java
List<Match> summary = scoreboard.calculateSummary();
```

 ### Finding a Match
To find a match in the scoreboard, use the `findMatch` method. This method takes two parameters: the home team and the away team, and returns the corresponding match if found.

```java
Match  foundMatch  = scoreboard.findMatch(poland, germany);
```

## Project Documentation

### Classes

#### `Scoreboard`

-   Manages ongoing matches and provides operations to start, update, and finish matches, as well as get a summary of matches.
-   Methods:
    -   `startMatch(Team homeTeam, Team awayTeam)`
    -   `findMatch(Team homeTeam, Team awayTeam)`
    -   `finishMatch(Match match)`
    -   `calculateSummary()`
    -   `getMatches()`

#### `Match`

-   Represents a football match with home team, away team, scores, and start date.
-   Methods:
    -   `updateScore(int homeTeamScore, int awayTeamScore)`
    -   Accessors for teams, scores, and start date.

#### `Team`

-   Represents a football team with a name.
-   Methods: accessor for team name.


## Assumptions
#### Exception Handling

-   Methods in the `Scoreboard` class, such as `startMatch`, `finishMatch`, and `updateScore`, may throw specific exceptions. 
    
-   The `startMatch` method in the `Scoreboard` class throws a `DuplicatedMatchException` if an attempt is made to start a match that already exists in progress (i.e., same home team and away team). 
    
-   The `finishMatch` method in the `Scoreboard` class throws a `MatchNotFoundException` if an attempt is made to finish a match that does not exist in the scoreboard. 
    
-   The `updateScore` method in the `Match` class throws a `NegativeScoreNumberException` if negative scores are provided as arguments.
